This is a basic introduction to our project and the steps on how to execute our code

----Introduction-----
Our project aims to identify unusual characteristics that can be detected in a herd using prediction techniques. We have applied deep learning concepts to our project.

----Execution steps----
1) Download the training dataset from www.hackerearth.com
2) Download a video of sheeps
2) Create a blank result.csv file
2) Create a blank test.csv file and have the names of the training images pasted as an entire column in that file and specify that path in the code 
3) Open IDE(preferably PyCharm as its easy to download and implement all the packages required for this project) and paste the code in a .py file
4) Install the required packages if its missing in the computer
5) Change the path of the video in the code to the place where the video of the sheep is downloaded
6) Create a testing dataset folder which will act as a place where the frames from the video will be storted
7) Change the path of the testing dataset folder in the code appropriately
8) Create another folder which will contain all the frames with bounds and change the path present in the code for this
9) Specify a path where the output video should be stored after proper execution in the code
10) Execute the code
11) Check the output
